When we started full-timing in the van we decided that we would take the van into shops to change the oil. The deciding factor was that we didn't want to find the space to carry an oily pan around with us everywhere. Plus we have enough undesirable liquid spills on our 20-year-old carpet.

The first time we paid for an oil change was a Jiffy Lube in Durham, NC.  It took hours and cost something outrageous - like $90.

The second oil change was in Morelia, Mich Mexico. It was done while we had the [fuel pump replaced for the first time.](https://reverdecer.annalisagross.com/2018/10/31/van-woes-and-wins-in-mexico/)  We had to rush to buy the oil and filter ourselves, but the oil change part of that day went smoothly. And cost less than the oil itself.

Third time we needed an oil change we were in San Antonio, TX on a Sunday. Nobody was open.  We ended up cutting a jug in half and using it to catch the oil as it dripped out.  The oil was recycled, but the jug was thrown away.  That kept us from having to haul an oily pan around, but a jug isn't a great tool for the job and it is a little wasteful.

Phillip longed for a better way.  Relying on whatever random shop we could find (or not find) wherever we were when it was time for the job was getting old.  First we switched to a synthetic-blend oil and increased the oil-change interval to 5000 miles.

Then the research turned up something interesting; the [Stahlbus oil drain valve.](http://www.stahlbus.com/products/en/oil-drain-valve/)  The plug that is normally removed to drain the oil pan is replaced with this ball valve. Then a short hose connects to the valve and directs the oil into a container.  It replaces the need for an oil pan.  Only having to carry an oily funnel and little hose makes diy oil changes desirable again.

The install was as easy as a normal oil change. After the oil was drained, I put the the new valve into the place where the old drain plug went.  I did add a drop of loctite to the threads since it shouldn't ever have to be removed.

Changing the oil filter can still be a messy process. I wonder how that will go without an oil drain pan. What about putting a plastic bag around the filter while loosening it? The Mobil 1 filter we're using "protects for up to 1 year or 20,000 miles." Is there any harm in changing it every other oil change (10,000 miles)? Leave your comments below!
